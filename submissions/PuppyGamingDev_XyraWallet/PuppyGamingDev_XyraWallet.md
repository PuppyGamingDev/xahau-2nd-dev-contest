* **Project Title**: Xyra Wallet
* **Brief Description**: Xyra Wallet is a Browser based XRPL & Xahau wallet which is a passion project of mine. The goal of being able to have a wallet that can be used on any device without the need to install an Extension or App, as long as they have a Browser. There are 2 parts to the Xyra project; the Signing Wallet, and the Wallet Dashboard. Everything important happens Client Side in the signing wallet, and the responses are passed back to the origin that requested it. The Wallet Dashboard was built simply as an easy way for end users to play and interact with the wallet until it is supported by other projects.
